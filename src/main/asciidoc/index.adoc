documentation snippets.

One showing the HTTP request:

//added so the test documentation is going to go out and generate snippets then asciidoctor is going to
// assemble  things into a single document and then use this to create a HTML doc
// the default location asciidoctor looks for this file is main/asciidoc/index.ado

// we are going to use Spring RestDocs to create snippets and then AsciiDcotor is going to assemble those
//snippets together into a single document in Build process
