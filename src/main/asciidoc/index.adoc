Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`BeerOrderControllerTest` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/orders/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-response.adoc[]

Response Body:
include::{snippets}/orders/response-body.adoc[]


Response Fields:
include::{snippets}/orders/response-fields.adoc[]
//added so the test documentation is going to go out and generate snippets then asciidoctor is going to
// assemble  things into a single document and then use this to create a HTML doc
// the default location asciidoctor looks for this file is main/asciidoc/index.ado

// we are going to use Spring RestDocs to create snippets and then AsciiDcotor is going to assemble those
//snippets together into a single document in Build process
